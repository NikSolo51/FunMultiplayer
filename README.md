# My solution for combining addresables and zenject
Addresables takes care of loading assets, and photon instantiates them.

```
        public GameObject Instantiate(string prefabId, Vector3 position, Quaternion rotation)
        {
            GameObject prefab = _asset.LoadSynchronously<GameObject>(prefabId);

            if (rotation == Quaternion.identity) rotation = prefab.transform.rotation;

            GameObject gameObject = InstantiateRegistered(prefab, position, rotation);
            return gameObject;
        }

        public void Destroy(GameObject gameObject)
        {
            GameObject.Destroy(gameObject);
        }
```
Replacing the standard instantiate with a custom one is possible thanks to IPunPrefabPool:

```
class GameFactory : IPunPrefabPool
```
And redefining the standard instantiate to custom

```
PhotonNetwork.PrefabPool = GameFactory : IPunPrefabPool;
```

# Addressable
The [Addressable Asset System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.addressables.html) (i.e., [Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.addressables.html)) is a Unity Editor and runtime asset management system that improves support for large production teams with complex live content delivery needs. The system uses asynchronous loading to support loading from any location with any collection of dependencies
